# Investment_Case_Study
This is the first group case study for the PGDDS program by Upgrad. This was a group exercise where we had to help a hypothetical firm decide where to invest. While all four members were involved with most of the process, there were specific tasks assigned to each person. For this case study, I was in-charge for making plots on Tableau.
